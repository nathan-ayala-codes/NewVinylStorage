This is my first project that I am going to attempt to make to completion. 
I have no experience in making a program from start to finsih besides in school.
This program is to help people who collect Vinyls like myself.
This program is supposed to be an optimized version of an application called Discogs.
There are many goals that I have for this program as I want to learn A LOT!
Some of the goals for this app are 
  > Finish a working version in terminal
  > Create a frontend via ?
  > Add an AI feature for making playlists out of the Vinyls you have!
  > Get a different person who also has Vinyls to use this app.
  > Potentially find someone to collaborate on this project with! (If you are reading this and want to collaborate, please DM me!)
